# Logical Bit Calculator

### CS50 Final Project 🚀

The **Logical Bit Calculator** is a Python-based project that simulates basic logic gates. It allows users to perform logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR on binary inputs. The project is modular, with unit tests to ensure functionality and correctness.

---

## 🔧 Features

- **Interactive Menu**: Users can choose from seven logic gates to perform binary operations.
- **Binary Input Validation**: Ensures inputs are strictly binary (0 or 1).
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive unit tests verify the accuracy of each logic gate function.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for understanding how logic gates work.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/logical-bit-calculator.git
    cd logical-bit-calculator
    ```

2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python project.py
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a logic gate and input binary values.

## 🧪 Running the Tests

To validate the logic gate functionality:
1. Execute the test script:
    ```bash
    python test_project.py
    ```

2. If all assertions pass, the logic gates are functioning correctly.

## 📝 Usage Example

### Interactive Menu
When you run `project.py`, you’ll see the following menu:
```text
1. AND Gate
2. OR Gate
3. NOT Gate
4. NAND Gate
5. NOR Gate
6. XOR Gate
7. XNOR Gate
Enter your choice:
```

### Sample Execution
- **Input**: Choose `1` for AND Gate. Enter inputs `1` and `0`.  
- **Output**: `Result: 0`

## 📚 Logical Gate Overview

| Gate    | Function Description                | Example Input | Example Output |
|---------|-------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| AND     | Returns 1 if both inputs are 1      | 1, 1          | 1              |
| OR      | Returns 1 if at least one input is 1| 0, 1          | 1              |
| NOT     | Returns the inverse of input        | 1             | 0              |
| NAND    | Returns the inverse of AND          | 1, 1          | 0              |
| NOR     | Returns the inverse of OR           | 0, 0          | 1              |
| XOR     | Returns 1 if inputs are different   | 0, 1          | 1              |
| XNOR    | Returns 1 if inputs are the same    | 1, 1          | 1              |
