# Logical Bit Calculator üßÆ

**CS50 Final Project ‚Äì Advanced Binary Logic Simulation**

The Logical Bit Calculator is an advanced Python-based application that simulates the behavior of fundamental logic gates. It‚Äôs designed to demonstrate core computational concepts while offering robust testing and extensibility for future enhancements. The project is ideal for enthusiasts, students, and developers working in digital logic, hardware simulation, or theoretical computation.

## üåü Features

- **Extensive Logic Gate Support**: Implements all primary logic gates:
  - AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.
- **Binary Validation**: Ensures strict binary inputs (0 or 1), providing resilience against invalid user input.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test suite written in Python validates functionality, ensuring high code reliability.
- **Modular Design**: The code is organized into reusable functions for easy integration and extension.
- **Educational & Practical**: Suitable for understanding basic logical operations or integrating into hardware simulators.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project follows a modular design for simplicity and scalability. Below is an overview of the code structure:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project.py          # Core application logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_project.py     # Unit test suite
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Documentation
```

### **Key Functions**
1. **Logic Gate Operations**:
   - Each logic gate is implemented as a standalone function (e.g., `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, etc.).
   - Functions strictly return binary results (0 or 1).
2. **Input Validation**:
   - `binary_value()` ensures only valid binary values are passed to the logic gates.
3. **Interactive Menu**:
   - Users select desired gates and provide inputs dynamically via the terminal.

### **Testing Framework**
The `test_project.py` script uses assertions to validate the behavior of each logic gate against expected outcomes. This ensures accuracy and serves as a foundation for continuous integration testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending the Project

This project is designed for extensibility. Below are some ideas for enhancement:

1. **Add Custom Gates**:
   - Extend functionality by creating complex logic gates (e.g., Multiplexers, Demultiplexers).
   - Example:
     ```python
     def IMPLIES(a, b):
         return OR(NOT(a), b)
     ```

2. **Multi-Bit Input Support**:
   - Modify logic gates to handle multi-bit binary inputs (e.g., `[1, 0, 1]`).

3. **GUI Integration**:
   - Create a graphical interface using libraries like `tkinter` or `PyQt` for enhanced user experience.

4. **Hardware Simulation**:
   - Integrate the logic gates into larger simulation systems for circuit design and testing.

## üìö Logical Gate Reference

| Gate    | Truth Table Example         | Implementation Logic             |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| AND     | `0 AND 1 = 0`               | Returns `1` if both inputs are `1` |
| OR      | `0 OR 1 = 1`                | Returns `1` if at least one input is `1` |
| NOT     | `NOT 1 = 0`                 | Returns the inverse of the input  |
| NAND    | `1 NAND 1 = 0`              | Returns inverse of AND operation  |
| NOR     | `0 NOR 0 = 1`               | Returns inverse of OR operation   |
| XOR     | `1 XOR 0 = 1`               | Returns `1` if inputs differ      |
| XNOR    | `1 XNOR 1 = 1`              | Returns `1` if inputs are the same |
